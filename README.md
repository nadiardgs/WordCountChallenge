# WordCountChallenge

This simple project counts the number of words in a TextBox.

When the "Submit" button is clicked, the content of the TextBox is evaluated. If empty, a label shows an error message to the user.
Else, special characters (tab, line feed and return carriage) are replaced by blank spaces. The remaining content is split into blank spaces, passed into a list, and the list length is returned.
